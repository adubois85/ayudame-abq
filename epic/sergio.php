		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p>Name: Sergio Garcia</p>
		<p>Age: 38</p>
		<p>Profession: For most of his adult life Sergio has worked in kitchens. He attended culinary school in Austin, TX
			when he was 25. More recently he has been diagnosed with diabetes which makes it hard for him to stand all day
			like he used to when he was younger; because of this, he has a hard time holding down a job. There are frequent
			days when he can't walk due to the pain in his legs and he has to call in sick to work; which in turn, frequently
			leaves him without gainful employment.
