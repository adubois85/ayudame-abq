		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p>Name: Sergio Garcia</p>
		<p>Age: 38</p>
		<p>Profession: Sergio has been working at Blue Cross Blue Shield for the last seven years. He is a customer support specialist. Everyday he answers customer questions about thier medical bills. The questions are generally simple but the answers are not always as simple. For instance, explaining why someone's insurance did not cover all the costs for a specific blood test is not always easy. Many times people become irrate and it is up to Sergio to them down. He is very good at his job and usually enjoys his time at work.
		</p>
		<p>Technology: More often than not, Sergio uses his three year old Toshiba Satellite laptop to access the internet and stay connected with his friends. He does own an iPhone 5 but since he does not have unlimited data he is very cautious about using his phone when he is not connected to wifi.
		</p>
		<p>Attitudes and Behaviour: On his days off, Sergio enjoys spending his time trying out new restaurants. Although he has never worked in a restaurant, Sergio has spent plenty of time and money exploring the restaurants in his city. He is willing to try anything, or any place, at least once. And because Sergio doesn't always know what he is eating, he finds comfort in knowing the restaurants he eats at have exemplary health inspections.
		</p>
		<p>Frustrations and Needs: Sergio remembers when he was a kid living in California that restaurants would post their inspection score on the windows of their store front. He has always liked that model and wishes there was an easy way for him to check the latest inspection results of the restaurants he eats at, especially the new ones.
		</p>
		<p>Goals: Sergio is looking to find a place where he cas easily search for health inspection results. His number one concern is ease of use. Most of the time he will be using his laptop but occasionally he will be searching with his iPhone.
