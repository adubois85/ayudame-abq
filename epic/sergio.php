		<h1>Persona</h1>
		<p>Name: Sergio Garcia</p>
		<p>Age: 38</p>
		<p>Profession: Sergio has been working at Blue Cross Blue Shield for the last seven years. He is a customer support
			specialist. Everyday he answers customer questions about thier medical bills. The questions are generally simple
			but the answers are not always as simple. For instance, explaining why someone's insurance did not cover all the
			costs for a specific blood test is not always easy. Many times people become irrate and it is up to Sergio to
			calm them down. He is very good at his job and usually enjoys his time at work.</p>
		<p>Technology: Since Sergio finds himself frequently unemployed, he does not have regular acces to his iPhone 5 but
			he does own an Dell laptop; it's about five years old. Sergio a regular Facebook user but is usually confined
			posting without adding any pictures since his iPhone is usually not in service.
		</p>
		<p>Attitudes and Behaviour: When he does have a job, he shares a 2004 Ford F150 with his wife as his main form of
			transportion. If his wife is using the truck he will usually take the city bus to get to work. Sergio does enjoy
			working in restaurants but as he gets older he finds his diabetes affects him more and more often. He is worried
			that, sooner rather than later, he will be forced into medical retirement, something he is not prepared for.
		</p>
		<p>Frustrations and Needs: As it is, his wife and him are not always able to pay rent on time and are sometimes
			left without enough money to eat healthy which only compounds his medical condition. They have received financial
			support from the state in the past but again they are usually not able to afford the more healthy options.
		</p>
		<p>Goals: Sergio needs to be able to find other sources of aid, whether financial or subsistence. If possible, he
			would like to be able to quickly search for available options from his laptop before he leaves his apartment.
			Since he shares a vehicle with his wife he would like to know exactly where he needs to go so he can complete
			his tasks in a timely manner.
